Step 3 :
Copy all DLLs and Executables from your build folder into the bin folder.
It should contain the following :
- plugins/platforms/qwindows.dll
- Qt6Core.dll
- Qt6Gui.dll
- Qt6Widgets.dll
- Qt6Charts.dll
- LuaLauncher.exe

Step 4 :
Copy qtadvanceddocking.dll from libs/ads/bin/ into the bin folder.

Step 5 :
Copy the following DLLs from you installation of mingw's bin folder into the bin folder :
- libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
- libstdc++-6.dll
- libwinpthread-1.dll

Step 5.5 (Optional) :
Run bin/client.exe and make sure you don't get any missing dll errors (which most likely means you forgot something).

Right click Taskk-Profiler.nsi and select "Compile NSIS Script"
